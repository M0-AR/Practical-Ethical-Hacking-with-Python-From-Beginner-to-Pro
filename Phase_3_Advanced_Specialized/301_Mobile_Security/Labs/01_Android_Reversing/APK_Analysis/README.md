- lib/
- res/
```

#### 1.2 Manifest Analysis
- Package name identification
- Permission analysis
- Component discovery
- Intent filters
- Security configurations

#### 1.3 Resource Analysis
- String extraction
- Layout analysis
- Asset inspection
- Configuration files

### 2. Intermediate Analysis
#### 2.1 Decompilation Techniques
```bash
# Convert DEX to JAR
d2j-dex2jar application.apk

# View Java source
jd-gui application.jar
```

#### 2.2 Code Analysis
- Identifying entry points
- Locating sensitive functions
- Understanding app flow
- Finding hardcoded secrets

#### 2.3 Dynamic Analysis Setup
- ADB configuration
- Logging setup
- Traffic interception
- Runtime manipulation

### 3. Advanced Analysis
#### 3.1 Advanced Static Analysis
- Custom decompiler scripts
- Automated analysis tools
- Pattern matching
- Control flow analysis

#### 3.2 Anti-Analysis Detection
- Root detection mechanisms
- Emulator detection
- Debugger detection
- Code obfuscation analysis

#### 3.3 Advanced Dynamic Analysis
- Frida hooking
- Runtime manipulation
- Memory analysis
- Native library analysis
